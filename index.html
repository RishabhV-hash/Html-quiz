      <h2>Objective Questions</h2>

      <p>What is the duration of the unit sample response of a digital filter?</p>
      <p>Infinite</p>

      <p>What is the relation between h(t) and Ha(s)?</p>
      <p>𝐻𝑎
        (𝑠) = ∫ ℎ(𝑡)𝑒
        −𝑠𝑡𝑑�</p>

      <p>Which of the following methods are used to convert analog filter into
        digital filter?</p>
      <p>All of the mentioned</p>

      <p>What is the difference equation of the FIR filter of
        length M, input x(n) and output y(n)?</p>
      <p> y(n)=∑ 𝑏𝑘𝑥(𝑛 − 𝑘)</p>

      <p>If the conversion technique is to be effective, the jΩ axis in the s-plane
        should map into the unit circle in the z-plane.</p>
      <p>True</p>
